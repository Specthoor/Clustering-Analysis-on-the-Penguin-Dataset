# Clustering-Analysis-on-the-Penguin-Dataset

Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem.
It is often used as a data analysis technique for
discovering interesting patterns in data, such as groups
of customers based on their behavior. An unsupervised
learning method is a method in which we draw
references from datasets consisting of input data
without labeled responses. Generally, it is used as a
process to find, meaningful, structure, explanatory,
underlying processes, generative features, and
groupings inherent in a set of examples. There are
many clustering algorithms to choose from and no
single best clustering algorithm for all cases. Instead,
it is a good idea to explore a range of clustering
algorithms and different configurations for each
algorithm.
