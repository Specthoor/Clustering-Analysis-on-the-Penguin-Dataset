# Clustering-Analysis-on-the-Penguin-Dataset

Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem.
It is often used as a data analysis technique for
discovering interesting patterns in data, such as groups
of customers based on their behavior. An unsupervised
learning method is a method in which we draw
references from datasets consisting of input data
without labeled responses. Generally, it is used as a
process to find, meaningful, structure, explanatory,
underlying processes, generative features, and
groupings inherent in a set of examples. There are
many clustering algorithms to choose from and no
single best clustering algorithm for all cases. Instead,
it is a good idea to explore a range of clustering
algorithms and different configurations for each
algorithm. This project looks to compare various clustering
algorithms on the penguin dataset and compare the
results of each algorithm. For this project, 3 main
algorithms would be considered.
1. K-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering
3. Model based clustering
